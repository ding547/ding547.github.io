As a doctoral student at the Spine Research Institute (SRI), I collaborate closely with our engineers and researchers, alongside our physicians, to delve into the challenges inherent in diagnosing and treating patients experiencing low back and neck pain. The prevailing discourse often revolves around the dearth of objective and actionable patient-specific data, which significantly complicates treatment approaches for these conditions. The variability in responses among patients underscores the complexity; what proves effective for one individual may not yield the same results for another, while the underlying causes often remain elusive.

Consequently, a substantial portion of our research endeavors and platform technology development initiatives are geared towards exploring innovative solutions. The objective is to furnish healthcare professionals and patients alike with enhanced insights throughout the care continuum. By doing so, we aim to facilitate the delivery of more effective and efficient care, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
