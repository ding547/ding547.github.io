I am Ke Ding, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual specializing in Biomechanics and Ergonomics, with a rich academic background from The Ohio State University. My journey, accentuated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and an M.S. in Biomedical Engineering, is now advancing towards a Ph.D. in Integrated Systems Engineering.

My current endeavors at The Spine Research Institute revolve around meticulous analysis and characterization of digital health information for low back and neck, enhancing the understanding of associated disorders. My experience at Dr. Benjamin Walterâ€™s Lab allowed me to delve deep into the mechanobiology of the musculoskeletal system, focusing on the nuanced aspects of nucleus pulposus in the intervertebral disc.

I passionately pursue excellence and innovation in biomechanics, with an emphasis on ergonomics, endeavoring to bridge the gap between theoretical principles and practical applications, aiming for breakthroughs that are conducive to human health and well-being.
